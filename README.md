# NlhH
Models of relevant proteins for my undergraduate thesis

All models are best visualized using ChimeraX (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).

Full data from foldseek analysis of NlhH (Table 2): use 
Model of NlhH (Figures 12, 13, 16): use **NlhH_full.pdb**
Aligned models of NlhH to other proteins (Figure 14): **use relevant alignment PDB files**
Docked model of NlhH to MHET (Figure 19): use **NlhH_MHET_bound.pdb**
