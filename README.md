# NlhH
Models of relevant proteins for my undergraduate thesis. All models are best visualized using ChimeraX (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).


Full data from foldseek analysis of NlhH (Table 2): use **Foldseek_PDB_results.zip**

Model of NlhH (Figures 12, 13, 16): use **NlhH_full.pdb**

Aligned models of NlhH to other proteins (Figure 14): **use relevant alignment PDB files**

Docked model of NlhH to MHET (Figure 19): use **NlhH_MHET_bound.pdb**

Model of rPPE taken from RCSB PDB 40B8 (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4ob8)

Model of IsMHETase taken from RCSB PDB 6QZ4 (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6QZ4)
